I statered with the starter template for Udacity's React Fundamentals course, developed by [React Training](https://reacttraining.com). I created a front-end in React to view your books that you want to read, currently reading, and have read.  I have also added the ability to add new books to your shelves.

## Installation

* Clone from Github.
* Run `npm install`

## Running Application

* Run `npm run start`

## Important
The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.
